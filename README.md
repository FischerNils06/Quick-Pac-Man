## Idea of the Game
This Game is a programmed version of a 2 year old Scratch Project. Here is the Link:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/511794000/

## Used Libraries
- pygame
- random
- time
- sys

## Used Images
In the folder "Grafiken" are all used images. The images are from created with Shapes in Microsoft Word.
I chose Word and not something more complex because the design was not my focus in this project.
